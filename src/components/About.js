            <div className="text-title">Dr. Takashi Kumagai Huynh, D.C.</div>
            <small className="text-brand">Doctor of Chiropractic</small>
            <p>His motivation for healthcare stems from an extensive personal struggle against his own body during his adolescence. In his youth, he visited countless doctors and underwent various tests, where unfortunately none of the doctors were able to specify what was going on. After years of tests, one doctor was able to diagnose him with a rare genetic disorder in fifteen short minutes just by listening to his symptoms.</p>
            <p>From there on, he knew that he wanted to instill that same relief to his patients. In his free time, he loves being active by playing basketball and running with friends. He also enjoys cooking new recipes to eatâ€¦ which drives him to keep being active!</p>
