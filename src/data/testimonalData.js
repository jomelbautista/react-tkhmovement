    text: "I initially came in to see Dr. Huynh for a shoulder injury that came from lifting weights. After I saw how diligent and passionate he was about his work, it was easy to see why he was so good at what he does. I now visit him whenever I have any sort of nagging pain and he is able to get down to the root cause of the injury and diagnose it. Not only does he heal the pain, he is proactive in helping me maintain an injury free life. I would recommend Dr. Huynh to anyone that is thinking about living without physical pain.",

    text: "I initially came in for lower back pains and worked with Dr. Huynh on exercises and techniques to alleviate the pain. After the first visit, I was able to see immediate results.<br>Most chiropractors will just adjust you and send you on your way, but with Dr. Huynh, we were able to tackle the lower back pain issue at its core and am glad to say that I no longer have this issue. Dr. Huynh will be my go-to chiropractor for any future issues I may come across and I would highly recommend Dr. Huynh for his expertise, but also his honesty in his treatments and expectations.",

    text: "Dr Huynh is very professional and actually listens to your concerns. He's very patient and walks you through his exercises while being attentive to how you follow through with them/gives you constructive feedback. He was also respectful and as a person who hates being touched, he always made sure I felt okay and let me know ahead of time where he needed to adjust me, which I appreciated. I felt that I was treated very well at Dr Huynh's clinic and he also sends you home with a take-home program of exercises. I came in with hip pain and after doing his exercises 4 times a week (even though he instructed everyday), the pain in my hip has greatly improved and I am able to work out more comfortably now. I would recommend him to my friends and family.",

    text: "I came in for shoulder rehab and Takashi put me through the best exercises. I am a collegiate athlete however I trust Takashi with his work and getting my shoulder right. I went in and told him what was wrong and right away he knew what exercises to put me through and he did hands on work to the shoulder which was amazing. He was very professional and easy to talk to and did a great job with my shoulder. The best part is he still keeps in touch and asks about my shoulder almost once a week and gives me more exercises to do to strengthen the shoulder.",

    text: "I've been dealing with chronic shoulder pains since I've gotten my surgery after dislocating my shoulder a few times in college. I started going to Dr. Huynh a few weeks ago and have been very delighted with the progress we're making. Dr. Huynh is able to start from the basic building blocks of making sure I'm using the correct breathing techniques to correct my form and then giving me the exercises I need to directly target the muscles around my shoulder and give me better stabilization. I've always felt like with other physical therapists I'm a little rushed when trying to understand the concepts/exercises but I haven't felt that type of pressure at all with Takashi. I'm very pleased with our progress and am very excited for where it's headed! I would recommend him to anyone!",

    text: "I've had great experiences at South Bay Rehab and Performance with Dr. Takashi Huynh. I first came in with lower back pain about 4 months ago and Dr. Huynh took the time to understand my symptoms, my daily routine/background, and he even took the time to put me through a mobility assessment before any adjustments. Afterwards, he provided me with the tools and exercises I needed to improve not only my lower back pain but overall health and fitness goals. Although my condition has improved drastically since my first visit, I now have a recurring cadence with Dr. Huynh to ensure I'm keeping up with my health and fitness. Can't recommend him enough!",
